        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Blue Milk, also known as Bantha Milk, was first spotted during a scene in <em>Star Wars: A New Hope </em> while Luke Skywalker sat sharing a meal with his aunt and uncle. While this version varies, I'm sure, from the milk produced by the female Banthas of Tatooine, this Star Wars <strong>Blue Milk Recipe is a delicious fruity drink that I'm sure you'll love!</strong></p>

        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel kiwi, cut into thirds, and blend until mostly smooth. Press contents of blender through a fine mesh strainer and place into a small bowl. Give blender a quick rinse.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add pineapple juice, watermelon juice, rice milk, coconut milk, lime juice, simple syrup, and a few drops of blue food coloring to blender. Measure out 2 tablespoons of kiwi pulp and add to blender. Blend until fully combined.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add xanthan gum to blender and blend for an additional 20-30 seconds - the blue milk should thicken up a little - add more xanthan gum ⅛ teaspoon a time until desired consistency is achieved. Adjust food coloring until desired blue coloring is achieved.</li>
        </ol>
