        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>The Ronto Wrap is a sandwich made from ronto meat served in a flat piece of bread called a ronto wrapper and topped with slaw and Clutch Sauce. They were available at podracing fanatic Bakkar's <em>Ronto Roasters</em> in Black Spire Outpost on the planet Batuu and were cooked by the pitmaster droid 8D-J8.</p>

        <p>The mechanic Salju and Resistance spy Vi Moradi both ordered Ronto Wraps while the former gave the latter a tour of the outpost. 8D-J8 once offered a Ronto Wrap to the Clawdite Remex Io, who turned it down.</p>
