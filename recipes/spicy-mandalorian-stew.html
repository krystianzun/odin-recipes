        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong><em>Tiingilar</em></strong> was a hearty and traditional Mandalorian stew made with a multicolored blend of meat, various vegetables, and a potent mix of spices. The mere scent of <em>tiingilar</em> was allegedly hot enough to burn an individual's nose hairs.</p>

        
        <p>Although the Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs was not a member of the predominantly human Mandalorian culture, he came into possession of a recipe for authentic <em>tiingilar</em>. Tuggs believed the flavorful dish's potency reflected the Mandalorian people's reputation for strength and their love of a challenge; according to him, the concoction was spicy enough to make even the hardiest Mandalorian warriors sweat themselves out of their armor when they consumed it.</p>
